Feature: Site menu
  In order to navigate the site's content
  as a visitor
  I can see a site navigation menu on every page


  Scenario: 
    Given the following pages:
      | title   | body                   | id                | site_menu_position | categories |
      | Whiskey | A page about Whiskey   | whiskey           | 2                  |            |

      | Tequila | All about Tequila      | tequila           | 1                  |            |
    And The GitModel database is indexed
    When I go to the path "/tequila"
    Then I should see the following list of links with css id "site-menu":
